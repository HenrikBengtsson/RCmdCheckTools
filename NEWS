Package: RCmdCheckTools
=======================

Version: 0.2.0 [2014-05-05]
o Added support for ~/.RCmdCheckTools-ignore and
  ~/.RCmdCheckTools-instignore.


Version: 0.1.9 [2014-01-28]
o Now packages with a single NOTE ("NOTE: There was 1 note.")
  are filed under "NOTE1".


Version: 0.1.8 [2014-01-05]
o Now URLs that packages wish to open are silently ignored, but
  setting system environment variable R_BROWSER=false, which makes
  utils::browseURL() return silently.  This is particularly useful
  for package opening a lot of pages, e.g. the 'sos' package.


Version: 0.1.7 [2014-01-04]
o WORKAROUND: No longer using the 'inconsolata' font when building
  the PDF manual on R (< 3.0.0).


Version: 0.1.6 [2013-10-18]
o Minor update to the generated email message.


Version: 0.1.5 [2013-09-25]
o BUG FIX: Forgot to install all dependencies of the package tested.


Version: 0.1.4 [2013-09-22]
o Now testPkgsToSubmit() will only update/install packages unless
  it was done recently (controlled by 'delta').
o Added arguments 'install', 'test', 'report' and 'delta' to
  testPkgsToSubmit().


Version: 0.1.3 [2013-09-19]
o Now the package to be submitted is also checked in the test setup.


Version: 0.1.2 [2013-09-19]
o The RSP report template no longer assumes R.utils is attached.


Version: 0.1.1 [2013-07-10]
o Updated the message template to CRAN such that the details on
  the tested reverse-recursive dependent packages are listed in
  a footnote.


Version: 0.1.0 [2013-05-18]
o Packages to be submitted are never considered reverse dependent
  of themselves, regardless of circular dependencies or not.
o Improved email message to CRAN.


Version: 0.0.9 [2013-03-10]
o Now getLibPaths() will append library paths to the stable release
  if current version of R is the developers version.
o Added getLibUserPath().


Version: 0.0.8 [2013-03-10]
o R.bin() would give a warning that the path does not exist.


Version: 0.0.7 [2013-01-15]
o Added support for PackagesToInstall.txt.


Version: 0.0.6 [2013-01-14]
o Now getLibPaths(collapse=TRUE) infers the R_LIBS separator from
  the system's PATH environment variable.
o Now getLibPath() used underscore and not commas to generate paths.
  This is because packages depending on Rcpp will not install from
  source if there are commas in the library path.


Version: 0.0.5 [2013-01-14]
o Now installAll() skips packages in PackagesToSkip,install.txt.
o Added argument 'which' to pkgsToSkip().
o ROBUSTNESS: Now all external calls to R are using the same R executable
  as the main session.
o ROBUSTNESS: Now getLibPath() ignores WARNING messages during R startup.
o Updated the CRAN email template.


Version: 0.0.4 [2012-12-02]
o Added support for PackagesToSkip.txt.


Version: 0.0.3 [2012-11-18]


Version: 0.0.2 [2012-xx-xx]
